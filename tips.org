#+title: Tips and tricks for this configuration

* Window management
- Press alt + arrows to move between windows. You can't do that in org-mode so use ~C-x o~ there.
- ~C-c C-r~ will transpose windows

* Git
** Magit Status buffer
- Press ~j~ and another letter to jump to any of the sections

** Git link
- ~C-c G H~ will take you to the repository home page. Useful when you push a commit and want to open a pull request

** Working with multiple emails
When working on a business computer you often omit your email from the global git configuration in
order to configure it on per-repository basis. You can customize ~my/emails~ in your site file like
this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq my/emails '("me@home.com" "me@work.com"))
#+END_SRC

Then run ~my/set-git-email~ to select one of these emails.

* Snippets
- ~C-M-/~ will list the available snippets with their respective keys
- ~M-/~ will expand a snippet key
